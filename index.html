        <p id="textboxtext">Synthesis is the creation of sounds using electronic methods. There are several types of synthesis, including subtractive, additive, FM, and granular synthesis. Subtractive synthesis involves starting with a complex waveform and removing frequencies using filters. Additive synthesis combines multiple simple waveforms to create complex sounds. FM synthesis uses one waveform to modulate another for dynamic sounds, while granular synthesis breaks down audio signals into tiny grains and rearranges them for unique textures. Each type of synthesis has its own strengths and limitations, and is suited for different applications.</p>
