          I am a 24 year old cyber security student at Davenport University.<br>
          Over the past 6 years, I've devoted my time to audio engineering as my hobby and passion.<br>
          I created this website and it features a synthesizer I made using the Web Audio API.<br>
          You can view all of the code for this website on my github page.<br>
          I have also learned how to write C++ applications and applications with python. <br>
          I created a text-to-speech application with python using the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.<br>
          I aim to create more complex audio applications in the future. <br>
          I`ve been working on 3D development. <br>
          I am using applications such as Blender, Unreal Engine, and Unity to create my projects. <br>
          Thank you for visiting my website!
